esign and implement the Rating Service.

Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation:

Assuming we have:

- 1000 surveys created by admins
- 10 questions per survey on average
- 1000 users taking each survey on average
- 5 response options per question (e.g., 1-5 rating)

We can estimate the following:

- Total number of surveys: 1000
- Total number of questions: 1000 x 10 = 10,000
- Total number of user responses: 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000
- Total number of response options: 10,000 x 5 = 50,000

Entities:

1. Survey: Represents a survey created by an admin.
    - Attributes: id, name, description, questions (list of Question entities)
2. Question: Represents a question in a survey.
    - Attributes: id, text, responseOptions (list of ResponseOption entities)
3. ResponseOption: Represents a response option for a question.
    - Attributes: id, text, value (e.g., 1-5 rating)
4. UserResponse: Represents a user's response to a survey question.
    - Attributes: id, surveyId, questionId, responseOptionId, userId
5. SurveyResult: Represents the result of a survey.
    - Attributes: id, surveyId, averageRating

Design Patterns:

1. Factory Pattern: We can use a factory pattern to create Survey, Question, and ResponseOption entities.
2. Repository Pattern: We can use a repository pattern to encapsulate data access and manipulation for each entity.
3. Service Pattern: We can use a service pattern to encapsulate business logic for survey creation, question addition, user response submission, and survey result calculation.

Algorithms:

1. Average Rating Calculation: We can use a simple average calculation algorithm to calculate the average rating for each survey result.
2. Survey Result Aggregation: We can use a grouping and aggregation algorithm to aggregate user responses by survey and question.

Database Schema:

We can design a database schema with the following tables:

1. Surveys: id, name, description
2. Questions: id, survey_id, text
3. ResponseOptions: id, question_id, text, value
4. UserResponses: id, survey_id, question_id, response_option_id, user_id
5. SurveyResults: id, survey_id, average_rating
