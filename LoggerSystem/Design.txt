Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation:

Assuming we have:

- 1000 microservices generating logs
- 100,000 logs generated per minute
- 1 KB average log size
- 1-year log retention period

We can estimate the following:

- Total logs generated per day: 100,000 logs/minute * 1440 minutes/day = 144,000,000 logs/day
- Total logs generated per year: 144,000,000 logs/day * 365 days/year = 52,560,000,000 logs/year
- Total storage required: 52,560,000,000 logs/year * 1 KB/log = 52,560 TB/year

Proposed Entities:

1. Log: Represents a single log entry with attributes like id, timestamp, logLevel, message, system, landscape, etc.
2. Logger: Represents a logger instance with attributes like id, name, logLevel, etc.
3. LogFilter: Represents a log filter with attributes like id, name, filterCriteria, etc.
4. LogAggregator: Represents a log aggregator with attributes like id, name, aggregationCriteria, etc.

Design Patterns:

1. Observer Pattern: We can use the observer pattern to notify the log aggregator when new logs are generated.
2. Factory Pattern: We can use the factory pattern to create logger instances based on the log level and other criteria.
3. Strategy Pattern: We can use the strategy pattern to implement different log filtering and aggregation strategies.

Algorithms:

1. Log Filtering: We can use algorithms like Bloom filters or prefix trees to efficiently filter logs based on various criteria.
2. Log Aggregation: We can use algorithms like MapReduce or Spark to efficiently aggregate logs across multiple systems and landscapes.

Database Sizing and Selection:

Based on our estimates, we'll need a database that can handle:

- High write throughput (100,000 logs/minute)
- Large storage capacity (52,560 TB/year)
- Efficient querying and filtering capabilities

We can consider using a distributed NoSQL database like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB, which can handle high write throughput and large storage capacity. For querying and filtering, we can use a database like Apache Elasticsearch or Amazon Elasticsearch Service, which provides efficient querying and filtering capabilities.

Additional Considerations:

1. Data Retention: We'll need to implement a data retention policy to ensure that logs are retained for the required period (1 year in this case).
2. Data Security: We'll need to implement data security measures to ensure that logs are encrypted and access-controlled.
3. Scalability: We'll need to ensure that the logger system is scalable to handle increasing log volumes and user traffic.
